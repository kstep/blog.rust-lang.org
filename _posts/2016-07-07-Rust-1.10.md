The Rust team is happy to announce the latest version of Rust, 1.10. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

As always, you can [install Rust 1.10][install] from the appropriate page on our
website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.10][notes] on GitHub.
1276 patches were landed in this release.

### What's in 1.10 stable

Rust 1.10 contains one of the most-requested features in Rust: through the [`-C
panic=abort` flag] or a [setting in your `Cargo.toml`], when a `panic!` happens,
it will abort, rather than unwind. Why would you want to do this? With an
abort, less code gets generated, meaning that binary sizes are a bit smaller,
and compilation time is ever-so-slightly faster. You give up the ability to
recover, however.

[`-C panic=abort` flag]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32900
[setting in your `Cargo.toml`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2687
[RFC 1513]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1513-less-unwinding.md

The second big feature in 1.10 is a new crate type: [`cdylib`]. Rust already has
one dynamic library format, `dylib`. These libraries are currently used everywhere
you need a dynamic library written in Rust, but as it turns out, there are two major
use-cases for them: writing a dynamic library to be used in a Rust project, and writing
a dynamic library to be embedded in some other language. The `dylib` format is focused
on the first case, and contains extraneous information that's unimportant for the second,
such as Rust-specific metadata. One final note about this feature: support is in the Rust
compiler, but not yet in Cargo.

[`cdylib`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33553
[RFC 1510]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1510-rdylib.md

[RFC 1521] has landed. This RFC ensures that every type that is `Copy` also [has
a `Clone` implementation]. Given that `Copy` is an implicit copy, `Clone` is an explicit
copy, the fact that some types which were `Copy` but not `Clone` felt wrong: if you can
implicitly copy something, you should be able to also call it explicitly. (But not the
reverse: many types are `Clone` but not `Copy`.) This has now been rectified.

[has a `Clone` implementation]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33420
[RFC 1521]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1521-copy-clone-semantics.md

In addition, [a number of performance improvements landed in the
compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#performance),
and so did [a number of usability
improvements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#usability)
across the documentation, `rustdoc` itself, and various error messages.

Finally, there's a large change to the way that we develop Rust that won't
impact Rust users directly, but will help those distributing Rust
significantly. Rust is implemented in Rust, which means that to build a copy of
Rust, you need a copy of Rust. This is commonly referred to as 'bootstrapping'.
Historically, we would do this by choosing a specific version of the compiler,
and then updating it periodically.  Furthermore, since the Rust compiler uses
unstable Rust features, in order to build a copy of the stable compiler, you
would need a specific version of the Rust compiler. This has served us well for
years, but we've outgrown it now. This approach has significant drawbacks, and
for an important constituency: Linux distributions. If they wanted to create a
package for stable Rust, they would also need a separate package, specifically
for bootstrapping their compiler. This is not great. As such, we have modified
our build system so that Rust 1.10 builds with Rust 1.9. In the future, this
pattern will continue; Rust 1.11 will be built with Rust 1.10. Furthermore, you
can use the stable compiler to build the compiler. This simplifies everything
around bootstrapping, and helps distribution maintainers significantly, as they
no longer need two packages. You can find more details about this change [in
its pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32942).

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.

#### Library stabilizations

Roughly 70 APIs were made stable in this release. They break down into these rough
groups:

* `std::os::windows::fs::OpenOptionsExt`, for Windows-specific file operations
* The ability to register and unregister panic hooks with `std::panic::{set,take}_hook`
* `CStr::from_bytes_with_nul`, to create a `CStr` from a byte slice (and an unchecked variant)
* Small improvements to `std::fs::Metadata`.
* `compare_exchange` for various atomic types
* A lot of UNIX-specific networking capabilities via
  `std::os::unix::net::{UnixStream, UnixListener, UnixDatagram, SocketAddr}`

In addition, `Default` was implemented for `&Cstr`, `CString`, `Path`,
`UnsafeCell`, `fmt::Error`, `Condvar`, `Mutex`, and `RwLock`.

Finally, on Linux, if HashMaps can't be initialized with `getrandom` they will
[fall back to `/dev/urandom` temporarily] to avoid blocking during early boot.

[fall back to `/dev/urandom` temporarily]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33086

#### Cargo features

Cargo has received a number of small improvements in this release.

First, the aforementioned [`profile.*.panic`] option can control how you'd like
panics implemented for your project.

[`profile.*.panic`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2687

Cargo now [reports its status to stderr rather than
stdout](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2693)

Rust keywords are now [banned from crate
names](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2707).

The [`--force` flag`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2405) has been
added to `cargo install`.

`cargo test` now takes a [`--doc`
flag](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2578) for running only
documentation tests.

[`cargo --explain` was added](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2551),
mirroring `rustc --explain`.
